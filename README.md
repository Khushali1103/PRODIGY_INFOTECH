# PRODIGY_INFOTECH  
Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents the tasks of my internship journey.

## Task 1 Overview  
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

### Knowledge Gained  
Task 1 improved my ability to create visualizations like bar charts and histograms to display the distribution of categorical or continuous variables, facilitating clearer insights into population demographics or other datasets.

## Task 2 Overview  
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

### Knowledge Gained  
Task 2 enriched my expertise in data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, refining competencies in data cleaning, EDA, and extracting actionable insights.

## Task 3 Overview  
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Knowledge Gained  
Task 3 strengthened my skills in machine learning, particularly in building and evaluating decision tree classifiers, and deepened my understanding of predictive modeling and customer behavior analysis.

## Task 4 Overview  
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

### Knowledge Gained  
Task 4 enhanced my ability to perform sentiment analysis and visualize sentiment trends in social media data, providing insights into public opinion and helping brands understand customer sentiments.
